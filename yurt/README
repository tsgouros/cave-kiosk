This directory contains the code for the kiosk software used to 
run the Brown YURT.  This was originally written by John Huffman, and
improved to add user accounts by Heather Sha, in 2016.

The files are stored for convenience, not services.  Use the
install.sh script to distribute them to their service locations. The
install must be run on the host machine, since it will be stored in a
machine-specific directory such as /var/www/html/...
